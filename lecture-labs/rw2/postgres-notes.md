# PostgreSQL
I downloaded the postgres.app and am interfacing with the command line
- I got the augur database created
- I created schemas and granted priveleges to user 'augur'
- I copied the sql scripts and ran them, but there were hella errors
- Upon running 'augur=# \c augur' & '\dt', psql is saying that there are no relations to view
